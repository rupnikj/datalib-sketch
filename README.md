# datalib-sketch

Probabilistic data structures for large or streaming data sets.

## Build Process

To use datalib-sketch in the browser, you need to build the datalib-sketch.js and datalib-sketch.min.js files. We use the [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build system along with [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to build the file.

1. Install gulp, as needed. Follow [step 1 on the Gulp Getting Started guide](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).
2. Run `npm install` in the datalib-sketch folder to install dependencies.
3. Run `gulp`.
